Need to update design to this template. 

https://bootstrapmade.com/devfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-html-template/

## Goals:

### Masking
Lets say if I'm working on a sub section and that is incomplete but I want to update till what ever I have done. 
If I do so, it won't be professional. So, i should have an option whether public can see or not. So that once I finish it completely I will give access to public.

### Flash cards
Need to create a tab for flash cards. In flash cards tab there should be decks and each decks will have flash cards.
In each clash card there will be a question on one side and answer on the other side. Each deck will consists of number of flash cards which are of the same group.
Example: Let say I want a deck for sql, pyhton etc. Inside each deck there will be few flash cards useful for quick references. Let say definitions or syntaxes or code snippets for popular codes etc.


## Goals accomplished:

### Redirecting

In contents tab, if you click on any one of the sub sections like introduction, course work, projects etc. It should redirect to that particular section.

### Text Editor
Lets say I have a piece of code. I need a text editor kind of mode. So, that it will show colors for the code I have uploaded. Example: Like github text editor, other websites like stackexchange, tutorials point etc. has that.

I will provide you the content in 3 days from now on.

## Projects

### Flying Humanoid Robot
### Helicoptor Control
In this project, I have designed and developed a Helicopter Control using Linear Quadratic Regulator. There are two cases, in the first case, the system equation is represented as x ̇=Ax+Bδ and in the second case the system equation has an additional linear noise and represented as x ̇=Ax+Bδ+Cz. As this is a real time project there are few restrictions embedded with each state variable. In order to satisfy every restriction and simultaneously getting the satisfiable performance out of system is a big task. Choosing Q and R values makes the system more stable. For both the cases all the four poles of my system are on the negative real axis. This means the system is stable. Controlling system on a non-windy day is much easier than a windy day.

### Adaptive cruise control simulation
Most of the road accidents have been known to be caused due to driver errors. As a result, automation of vehicles to increase highway safety and driver’s performance has gained popularity in the recent era. An example of such automation is cruise control which allows a vehicle to follow a lead vehicle in the longitudinal direction. It is the responsibility of the driver to initially set the distance between his/her vehicle and the lead vehicle, and to maintain the vehicle in the center of the lane. In this project, we propose to implement Adaptive Cruise Control using a direct Model Reference Adaptive controller (MRAC). The control objective, in this case, is to make the relative speed zero as time tends to infinity and to maintain the following distance. The vehicle model developed for this problem, based on the laws of physics and experimental data is a complex non-linear system. However, for MRAC we assume a simplified first order system.
