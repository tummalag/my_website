## Goals:

### Login
Have to provide editing option for the user to update the contents.

### Recent changes
Need to update what user has recently changed in the website in recent changes tab.

### Text Editor
Lets say I have a piece of code. I need a text editor kind of mode. So, that it will show colors for the code I have uploaded. Example: Like github text editor, other websites like stackexchange, tutorials point etc. has that.


## Goals accomplished:
### Redirecting

In contents tab, if you click on any one of the sub sections like introduction, course work, projects etc. It should redirect to that particular section.
