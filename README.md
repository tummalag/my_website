# my_website

## Goals:

### Login
Have to provide editing option for the user to update the contents.

### Recent changes
Need to update what user has recently changed in the website in recent changes tab.

### Masking
Lets say if I'm working on a sub section and that is incomplete but I want to update till what ever I have done. 
If I do so, it won't be professional. So, i should have an option whether public can see or not. So that once I finish it completely I will give access to public.

### Flash cards
Need to create a tab for flash cards. In flash cards tab there should be decks and each decks will have flash cards.
In each clash card there will be a question on one side and answer on the other side. Each deck will consists of number of flash cards which are of the same group.
Example: Let say I want a deck for sql, pyhton etc. Inside each deck there will be few flash cards useful for quick references. Let say definitions or syntaxes or code snippets for popular codes etc.


## Goals accomplished:
### Redirecting

In contents tab, if you click on any one of the sub sections like introduction, course work, projects etc. It should redirect to that particular section.

### Text Editor
Lets say I have a piece of code. I need a text editor kind of mode. So, that it will show colors for the code I have uploaded. Example: Like github text editor, other websites like stackexchange, tutorials point etc. has that.
